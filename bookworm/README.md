On the hunt for a new book, but not sure know where to start looking? This tool can help narrow your search! Using a collaborative filtering engine, this recommender will find books with the highest similarity scores with the one you already love, based off a database of almost 6 million reviews of 10,000 of the most popular books in the world, from over 50,000 Goodreads users. Happy reading!

This dashboard was created by David Alfego, utilizing Dash by Plotly and hosted on Heroku. The dataset, goodreads-10k, was obtained from FastML (http://fastml.com/goodbooks-10k). The collaborative filtering model uses cosine similarity to measure highest relationship among categories. Thanks!
